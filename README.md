# Teenage Horsetooth Survival Guide and Engineering Handbook for the 80's and 90's

Idea:

Book is organized as a series of engineering tips and projects,
interspersed with stories from the events of Horsetooth in the 80s and early 90s.
The focus is on doing a lot with very little:
building useful, fun stuff from affordable and readily available materials
using only common tools, without an elaborate workshop.

Stories provide GPS coordinates of where events took place.

A big themes are board sports (skate, snow, wake, skim) and climbing.


# Introduction

Before entering kindergarden in 1979, my family moved to the foothills
of the Colorado Rockies just west of Fort Collins.
Shortly in the years that followed I made friends with
James Kennedy, Aaron Haas, John Frederick, and Mark Harvey
and we grew up together in this region known as Horsetooth:
named after the rock on the highest ridge, which overlooks
the town and most of the Front Range -- on a clear day
from the top of Horsetooth rock you can see Cheannye, Wyoming
to the north, Pike's Peak to the south, Long's Peak to the west,
and the western edge of The Great Plains to the east.
Horsetooth is also is the name
of the reservoir that fills the valley between the first
and second hogback ridges nearest to town.
The five of us lived in the sourrounding hills
near the shores of Inlet Bay: the largest of the seven
or eight coves of Horsetooth Resvervoir; named because
it provided the inlet to the reservoir with the source
waters originated from the Colorado River,
odd considering that the Colorado is  .


In the early 80's, five kids living in the foothills west of Fort Collins,
Colorado became friends and grew up together.
I first met James Kennedy one day riding home on the school bus in the 
second grade; get gave me is his phone number and I worked on memorizing it
before he got off the bus.  

This book provides general know-how for building and riding stuff.
How to build and construct fun stuff few resources and non budget. 
...

But this book is also about a group of friends growing up in the 80's and 90's in the foothills west of Fort Collins, Colorado;
an area known as Horsetooth, named for the rock resting on the highest ridge overlooking
the town and also the reservoir that fills the valley between the first pair of hogback ridges.
John Frederick, Aaron Haas, Mark Harvey, Tom Hawkins, and James Kennedy made of the core
group and were often accomonied by Micheal (John's brother), Jerry (James' brother),
and Fon "Allen" Duke who moved to the neighborhood and joined the group for a few years.


# Shop Skills

## Safety: Protecting Hands, Eyes, Hears, and Lungs

- Leather gloves.
- Safety glasses.
- Ear plugs.
- N95 respirator.

## Tools

This guide strives for minimal, afordable tools -- and some tools we will make ourselves.
Also, no extravegant workshop space.

It's easy to build stuff if you access to a spacious workshop stocked with every 
tool imaginable.  It's hard  

Assumes only hand tools and some power tools,
but no benchtop machines and no floor standing machines
and no welding.




## Sewing
## Chemistry

# Wood and Metalworking

I intensionally use the term woodworking instead of
carpentry because the later tends to conjure images of intricate
hand tools, dovetail joints, and beautifully crafted furniature pieces.
Whereas in our world of Horsetooth, wood served as a means to 
and end, it was not the end itself.
We often used wood due to its availablity,
the ease of working with it,
and its charaterists of light weight
and strength to enhance the
end product of whatever we happend to be working towards.
This is not to say we were all about function and no form.
Wood is an excellent engineering material,
but it also has an incredablty beauty when properly finished --
I think we appreciated both aspects.

## Determining Required Accuracy

## Measuring the Distance Between Mounting Holes

## Accurate Marking

- Vee marks vs just a single marks.
- Marks have thickness.  Make marks wide using the edge of the mark, not the center, to mark the location.

## Drilling Straight, Accurate, and Clean Holes

## Making and Transfering Symetric Templates

## Sawing with Accuracy

## Squaring a Board

## Securing and Clamping Work

## Gluing Boards without Clamps

## Block and Tackle

## Sharpening Knives, Sciscors, and Chisels

## Cutting Threaded Rod and Cleaning End Threads

## Project: Optical Drilling Alignment Tool

## Project: Mobile Workbench

## Project: Tow Rope Spool

# Poly Rope and Splicing

Polypropylene (aka. poly) rope is horrible rope to work with.
It's slippery making it hard to grip and pull.
You can tie knots with it, but once knots are heavily loaded
they are almost impossible to untie.
And if you are able to untie them, they will leave your
rope permanantely bent and crumpled.

Worst still, polypropylene rope has a low melting point
making it inappropriate for any application that depends on
dynamic friction.  For example, rapelling off a cliff
with poly rope will have one of two outcomes:
Either the rope will be too slipery and you won't
be able to generate enough friction, or you
can generate the friction, but the heat produced promptly
melts the rope.  Regardless, the result is the same:
your dead body on the rocks below.

So if polypropylene rope is this bad, why devote an entire
section to it?
Answer: Because it's cheap and is
excellent for waterski/wakeboard towing applications.


Polypropylene (aka. Poly) rope is inexpensive
and makes for a great tow rope since it floats on water.

3/8 inch (yellow) poly rope costs about $15 per 100 feet and
has a working load limit of about 215 pounds,
enough for most human towing applications, e.g. wakeboarding.


Hollow braid, not 3 strand twisted.

- Splicing:
  - Connecting two ropes to make one.
  - Creating a loop.

WARNING: Poly rope can store a fair amount
energy in its stretch.  Ensure no one is inline
with a rope under tension.  Always assume the rope will break
or the rider looses grip of the handle at any moment
and situate your towing setup accordingly.
Ensure no one is inline with the rope in front
of the rider, even up to and past the winch.

Lots of BS thrown around out there.

to judge what others claim.
