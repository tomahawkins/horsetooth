# Teenage Horsetooth Engineering Handbook

Idea:

Book is organized as a series of engineering tools, tips and, projects,
mostly focusing on board sports (skim, snow, wake, skate),
interspersed with stories from the events of Horsetooth in the 80s and early 90s.
The goal is to achieve a lot very little: growing up we didn't have
much in term tools, materials, and places to work, but we
made due with what we could find.

Stories provide GPS coordinates of where events took place.


# Introduction

Before entering kindergarden in 1979, my family moved to the foothills
of the Colorado Rockies just west of Fort Collins.
Shortly in the years that followed I made friends with
James Kennedy, Aaron Haas, John Frederick, and Mark Harvey
and we grew up together in this region known as Horsetooth:
named after the rock on the highest ridge, which overlooks
the town and most of the Front Range -- on a clear day
from the top of Horsetooth rock you can see Cheannye, Wyoming
to the north, Pike's Peak to the south, Long's Peak to the west,
and the western edge of The Great Plains to the east.
Horsetooth is also is the name
of the reservoir that fills the valley between the first
and second hogback ridges nearest to town.
The five of us lived in the sourrounding hills
near the shores of Inlet Bay: the largest of the seven
or eight coves of Horsetooth Resvervoir; named because
it provided the inlet to the reservoir with the source
waters originated from the Colorado River,
odd considering that the Colorado is  .


In the early 80's, five kids living in the foothills west of Fort Collins,
Colorado became friends and grew up together.
I first met James Kennedy one day riding home on the school bus in the 
second grade; get gave me is his phone number and I worked on memorizing it
before he got off the bus.  

This book provides general know-how for building and riding stuff.
How to build and construct fun stuff few resources and non budget. 
...

But this book is also about a group of friends growing up in the 80's and 90's in the foothills west of Fort Collins, Colorado;
an area known as Horsetooth, named for the rock resting on the highest ridge overlooking
the town and also the reservoir that fills the valley between the first pair of hogback ridges.
John Frederick, Aaron Haas, Mark Harvey, Tom Hawkins, and James Kennedy made of the core
group and were often accomonied by Micheal (John's brother), Jerry (James' brother),
and Fon "Allen" Duke who moved to the neighborhood and joined the group for a few years.




# Critical Thinking

To uncover and distinguish between solid facts (truth),
probably truths, and falsehoods.

To identify and reduce bias.

If a good friend states something,
you will be more inclinded to believe it, even if it's not true.
When this happens, image someone you don't like very much,
saying the same thing in an arogent, condecending way.
Do you still believe it?

## Confirmation Bias

Research statements that interest you,
but bewary of confirmation bias.

Periodically question your beliefs.
Play devils advocate and find counter arguments
to your beliefs.



Lots of BS floating about.

Unfortunately the internet and social media has made it
too easy for people to spread unintentional
and sometime malious falsehoods.

Use first principles, facts, and reasoning
to judge what others claim.
Train yourself to analyze each statement you hear and see
giving it a measure of truth (how probably the statement is).




# Frustration

Rushing to finish
as project you feel is almost done, but
you've been at it for hours?
Starting to feel burnt-out?

Time to take a break.  Go eat something.  Get some
exersize.  Take nap.  Your brain needs a rest.

If you continue on, it's just going to get worse,
and you will likely make a big mistake, which will
only compound your frustration.

You will be much better off to take a break
and then come back to it after you have rested.
Though you feel bad now, after your rest you will be amazed 
how you feel and how productive you are.

Do something completely different to force
your mind to think of something else;
preferably do something where you don't have to
think much at all.  But whatever you do, don't
let your mind wonder back to the problem.
The reason you feel frustrated is because your mind is saturated 
on the problem and it needs a break; be sure
to give it one.



# Failure

Failure will happen.  It's not a question of if --
it's not even a question of when, but how often
and how big are they going to be.

Things rarely work the first time around, especially
if you are attempting something new.
Keep your expectations low and just expect 
it not to work on the first, second, or third try.

As painful and frustrating as it is, failure is the best teacher.
The more we fail, the more we learn.
Of course we can blindly go about trying things and failing,
and we will eventually get something that works.

But there is a better way to go about it.
The key is to maximize what we learn from each failure,
so we can effectively lower our total number of failures
for us to learn what we need to learn to complete a project.

When you fail, chances are you will be nearing your frustration limit.
If so, stop everything and take a break.
Only after when you have a clear head and are in a good
mood, critically analyze the failure.

Why did it occur?
Was it due to an oversight or a mistake?
Was the mistake easy to to make, and if so,
can you change something that would make
it harder, or better yet,
would elminate the possiblity of the mistake being repeated?

What was the consequence of the failure?
Is there a potential safety hazzard involved?

Looking at this specific failure, can you foresee other similar
failures that can occur?
And if you are to identify a class of potential failures,
can you think of anything that would mitigate the entire class?
Make these insights can be absolute gold.
Yes, you can probably go back and patch a fix to 
prevent the failure from occuring again.
But identifying entire classes of failures,
and finding mitigations to the entire class
results in a far more robust product or process,
and can lead to true revolution in design.









# Requirements Before Design

- Must-haves, hard requirements, rules.
- Nice-to-haves, soft requirements, guidelines.
- Not intended.

Forcing yourself to seriously think about what's actually needed
from a project before starting to delve into the design
thing about how to build
the project can lead to interesting discoveries and 
revolutionary design.

All too often commercial product design does not follow this approach, 
but is more evolutionary, taking what's what's
already been done before and then adding new features and
asteticts.  This can lead to some improvement over time
with each iteration, but often it also carries along bad concepts
and poorly thought out ideas just because they have been
copied and carried forward so many times that they
become standard even when they don't provide much utility.

# Shop Skills

## Safety: Protecting Hands, Eyes, Hears, and Lungs

- Leather gloves.
- Safety glasses.
- Ear plugs.
- N95 respirator.

## Tools

This guide strives for minimal, afordable tools -- and some tools we will make ourselves.
Also, no extravegant workshop space.

It's easy to build stuff if you access to a spacious workshop stocked with every 
tool imaginable.  It's hard  

Assumes only hand tools and some power tools,
but no benchtop machines and no floor standing machines
and no welding.

# Wood and Metalworking

I intensionally use the term woodworking instead of
carpentry because the later tends to conjure images of intricate
hand tools, dovetail joints, and beautifully crafted furniature pieces.
Whereas in our world of Horsetooth, wood served as a means to 
and end, it was not the end itself.
We often used wood due to its availablity,
the ease of working with it,
and its charaterists of light weight
and strength to enhance the
end product of whatever we happend to be working towards.
This is not to say we were all about function and no form.
Wood is an excellent engineering material,
but it also has an incredablty beauty when properly finished --
I think we appreciated both aspects.

# Poly Rope and Splicing

Polypropylene (aka. poly) rope is horrible rope to work with.
It's slippery making it hard to grip and pull.
You can tie knots with it, but once knots are heavily loaded
they are almost impossible to untie.
And if you are able to untie them, they will leave your
rope permanantely bent and crumpled.

Worst still, polypropylene rope has a low melting point
making it inappropriate for any application that depends on
dynamic friction.  For example, rapelling off a cliff
with poly rope will have one of two outcomes:
Either the rope will be too slipery and you won't
be able to generate enough friction, or you
can generate the friction, but the heat produced promptly
melts the rope.  Regardless, the result is the same:
your dead body on the rocks below.

So if polypropylene rope is this bad, why devote an entire
section to it?
Answer: Because it's cheap and is
excellent for waterski/wakeboard towing applications.


Polypropylene (aka. Poly) rope is inexpensive
and makes for a great tow rope since it floats on water.

3/8 inch (yellow) poly rope costs about $15 per 100 feet and
has a working load limit of about 215 pounds,
enough for most human towing applications, e.g. wakeboarding.


Hollow braid, not 3 strand twisted.

- Splicing:
  - Connecting two ropes to make one.
  - Creating a loop.

WARNING: Poly rope can store a fair amount
energy in its stretch.  Ensure no one is inline
with a rope under tension.  Always assume the rope will break
or the rider looses grip of the handle at any moment
and situate your towing setup accordingly.
Ensure no one is inline with the rope in front
of the rider, even up to and past the winch.




# Wetsuit

Expensive, but in some cases it can triple the length of the swimming season.
Don't try to save money by getting a spring suit (shorts, short sleaves).
Full suit, 4/3 mm thickness.
Horsetooth was always chilly, even in the middle of summer.
Even in summer, a wetsuit makes it comfortable to stay in the
water all day.
