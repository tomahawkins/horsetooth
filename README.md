Horsetooth Engineering Field Manual and Teenage Survival Guide for the Late 80s
===============================================================================

Idea:

Book is a series of engineering tools, tips and, projects, covering
bike, board (skim, snow, wake, skate), motor sports, and general
adventuring in and around the Horsetooth areas interspersed with stories
of the [events](09_events.md) that took place.

One goal is to convey achieving a lot with a little: growing up we
didn't have much in term of money, tools, materials, or places to work,
but we made due and had a blast doing it.

Stories provide GPS coordinates of where the various actors lived and
where events took place.

Introduction
============

Principle participants:

Jeromy Deale ("Deale") Fon Duke ("Allen") John Frederick Michael
Frederick Jeff Gerard Aaron Haas Mark Harvey ("Harv") Tom Hawkins James
Kennedy Jerry Kennedy Jeremy Merck ("Merck")

Before entering kindergarten in 1979, my family moved to the foothills
of the Colorado Rockies just west of Fort Collins. Shortly in the years
that followed I made friends with James Kennedy, Aaron Haas, John
Frederick, and Mark Harvey and we grew up together in this region known
as Horsetooth: named after the rock on the highest ridge, which
overlooks the town and most of the Front Range -- on a clear day from
the top of Horsetooth rock you can see Cheyenne, Wyoming to the north,
Pike's Peak to the south, Long's Peak to the west, and the western edge
of The Great Plains to the east. Horsetooth is also is the name of the
reservoir that fills the valley between the first and second hogback
ridges nearest to town. We lived in the surrounding hills near the
shores of Inlet Bay: the largest of the seven or eight coves of
Horsetooth Reservoir; named because it provided the inlet to the
reservoir with the source waters originated from the Colorado River, odd
considering that the Colorado is .

In the early 80's, five kids living in the foothills west of Fort
Collins, Colorado became friends and grew up together. I first met James
Kennedy one day riding home on the school bus in the second grade; get
gave me is his phone number and I worked on memorizing it before he got
off the bus.

This book provides general know-how for building and riding stuff. How
to build and construct fun stuff few resources and non budget. ...

But this book is also about a group of friends growing up in the 80's
and 90's in the foothills west of Fort Collins, Colorado; an area known
as Horsetooth, named for the rock resting on the highest ridge
overlooking the town and also the reservoir that fills the valley
between the first pair of hogback ridges.

Preliminaries
=============

Critical Thinking
-----------------

To uncover and distinguish between solid facts (truth), probably truths,
and falsehoods.

To identify and reduce bias.

If a good friend states something, you will be more inclined to believe
it, even if it's not true. When this happens, image someone you don't
like very much, saying the same thing in an arrogant, condescending way.
Do you still believe it?

### Confirmation Bias

Research statements that interest you, but be wary of confirmation bias.

Periodically question your beliefs. Play devils advocate and find
counter arguments to your beliefs.

Lots of BS floating about.

Unfortunately the internet and social media has made it too easy for
people to spread unintentional and sometime malicious falsehoods.

Use first principles, facts, and reasoning to judge what others claim.
Train yourself to analyze each statement you hear and see giving it a
measure of truth (how probably the statement is).

Frustration
-----------

Rushing to finish as project you feel is almost done, but you've been at
it for hours? Starting to feel burnt-out?

Time to take a break. Go eat something. Get some exercise. Take nap.
Your brain needs a rest.

If you continue on, it's just going to get worse, and you will likely
make a big mistake, which will only compound your frustration.

You will be much better off to take a break and then come back to it
after you have rested. Though you feel bad now, after your rest you will
be amazed how you feel and how productive you are.

Do something completely different to force your mind to think of
something else; preferably do something where you don't have to think
much at all. But whatever you do, don't let your mind wonder back to the
problem. The reason you feel frustrated is because your mind is
saturated on the problem and it needs a break; be sure to give it one.

Failure
-------

Failure will happen. It's not a question of if -- it's not even a
question of when, but how often and how big are they going to be.

Things rarely work the first time around, especially if you are
attempting something new. Keep your expectations low and just expect it
not to work on the first, second, or third try.

As painful and frustrating as it is, failure is the best teacher. The
more we fail, the more we learn. Of course we can blindly go about
trying things and failing, and we will eventually get something that
works.

But there is a better way to go about it. The key is to maximize what we
learn from each failure, so we can effectively lower our total number of
failures for us to learn what we need to learn to complete a project.

When you fail, chances are you will be nearing your frustration limit.
If so, stop everything and take a break. Only after when you have a
clear head and are in a good mood, critically analyze the failure.

Why did it occur? Was it due to an oversight or a mistake? Was the
mistake easy to to make, and if so, can you change something that would
make it harder, or better yet, would eliminate the possibility of the
mistake being repeated?

What was the consequence of the failure? Is there a potential safety
hazard involved?

Looking at this specific failure, can you foresee other similar failures
that can occur? And if you are to identify a class of potential
failures, can you think of anything that would mitigate the entire
class? Make these insights can be absolute gold. Yes, you can probably
go back and patch a fix to prevent the failure from occurring again. But
identifying entire classes of failures, and finding mitigations to the
entire class results in a far more robust product or process, and can
lead to true revolution in design.

Requirements Before Design
--------------------------

-   Must-haves, hard requirements, rules.
-   Nice-to-haves, soft requirements, guidelines.
-   Not intended.

Forcing yourself to seriously think about what's actually needed from a
project before starting to delve into the design thing about how to
build the project can lead to interesting discoveries and revolutionary
design.

All too often commercial product design does not follow this approach,
but is more evolutionary, taking what's what's already been done before
and then adding new features and aesthetics. This can lead to some
improvement over time with each iteration, but often it also carries
along bad concepts and poorly thought out ideas just because they have
been copied and carried forward so many times that they become standard
even when they don't provide much utility. See Critical Thinking,
Analysis, and Reasoning.

Shop Skills
===========

Safety: Protecting Hands, Eyes, Hears, and Lungs
------------------------------------------------

-   Leather gloves.
-   Safety glasses.
-   Ear plugs.
-   N95 respirator.

Tools
-----

This guide strives for minimal, affordable tools -- and some tools we
will make ourselves. Also, no extravagant workshop space.

It's easy to build stuff if you access to a spacious workshop stocked
with every tool imaginable. It's hard

Assumes only hand tools and some power tools, but no benchtop machines
and no floor standing machines and no welding.

Wood and Metalworking
=====================

I intentionally use the term woodworking instead of carpentry because
the later tends to conjure images of intricate hand tools, dovetail
joints, and beautifully crafted furniture pieces. Whereas in our world
of Horsetooth, wood served as a means to and end, it was not the end
itself. We often used wood due to its availability, the ease of working
with it, and its characteristics of light weight and strength to enhance
the end product of whatever we happened to be working towards. This is
not to say we were all about function and no form. Wood is an excellent
engineering material, but it also has an incredibility beauty when
properly finished -- I think we appreciated both aspects.

Untangling Tangled Rope
-----------------------

Raising and Lowering \[Non Human\] Loads
----------------------------------------

Slinging a Load
---------------

Poly Rope and Splicing
======================

Polypropylene (aka. poly) rope is horrible rope to work with. It's
slippery making it hard to grip and pull. You can tie knots with it, but
once knots are heavily loaded they are almost impossible to untie. And
if you are able to untie them, they will leave your rope permanently
bent and crumpled.

Worst still, polypropylene rope has a low melting point making it
inappropriate for any application that depends on dynamic friction. For
example, rappelling off a cliff with poly rope will have one of two
outcomes: Either the rope will be too slippery and you won't be able to
generate enough friction, or you can generate the friction, but the heat
produced promptly melts the rope. Regardless, the result is the same:
your dead body on the rocks below.

So if polypropylene rope is this bad, why devote an entire section to
it? Answer: Because it's cheap and is excellent for waterski/wakeboard
towing applications.

Polypropylene (aka. Poly) rope is inexpensive and makes for a great tow
rope since it floats on water.

3/8 inch (yellow) poly rope costs about \$15 per 100 feet and has a
working load limit of about 215 pounds, enough for most human towing
applications, e.g. wakeboarding.

Hollow braid, not 3 strand twisted.

-   Splicing:
-   Connecting two ropes to make one.
-   Creating a loop.

WARNING: Poly rope can store a fair amount energy in its stretch. Ensure
no one is inline with a rope under tension. Always assume the rope will
break or the rider looses grip of the handle at any moment and situate
your towing setup accordingly. Ensure no one is inline with the rope in
front of the rider, even up to and past the winch.

Wetsuit
=======

Expensive, but in some cases it can triple the length of the swimming
season. Don't try to save money by getting a spring suit (shorts, short
sleeves). Full suit, 4/3 mm thickness. Horsetooth was always chilly,
even in the middle of summer. Even in summer, a wetsuit makes it
comfortable to stay in the water all day.
