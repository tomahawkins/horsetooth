# Poly Rope and Splicing

Polypropylene (aka. poly) rope is horrible rope to work with.
It's slippery making it hard to grip and pull.
You can tie knots with it, but once knots are heavily loaded
they are almost impossible to untie.
And if you are able to untie them, they will leave your
rope permanently bent and crumpled.

Worst still, polypropylene rope has a low melting point
making it inappropriate for any application that depends on
dynamic friction.  For example, rappelling off a cliff
with poly rope will have one of two outcomes:
Either the rope will be too slippery and you won't
be able to generate enough friction, or you
can generate the friction, but the heat produced promptly
melts the rope.  Regardless, the result is the same:
your dead body on the rocks below.

So if polypropylene rope is this bad, why devote an entire
section to it?
Answer: Because it's cheap and is
excellent for waterski/wakeboard towing applications.


Polypropylene (aka. Poly) rope is inexpensive
and makes for a great tow rope since it floats on water.

3/8 inch (yellow) poly rope costs about $15 per 100 feet and
has a working load limit of about 215 pounds,
enough for most human towing applications, e.g. wakeboarding.

- Splicing:
  - Connecting two ropes to make one.
  - Creating a loop.

WARNING: Poly rope can store a fair amount
energy in its stretch.  Ensure no one is inline
with a rope under tension.  Always assume the rope will break
or the rider looses grip of the handle at any moment
and situate your towing setup accordingly.
Ensure no one is inline with the rope in front
of the rider, even up to and past the winch.
