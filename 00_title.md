# Horsetooth Engineering Field Manual and Teenage Survival Guide for the Late 80s

Idea:

Book is a series of engineering tools, tips and, projects,
covering bike, board (skim, snow, wake, skate), motor sports,
and general adventuring in and around the Horsetooth areas
interspersed with stories of the [events](events.md) that took place.

One goal is to convey achieving a lot with a little:
growing up we didn't have
much in term of money, tools, materials, or places to work, but we
made due and had a blast doing it.

Stories provide GPS coordinates of where events took place.
