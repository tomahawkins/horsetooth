# Preliminaries

## Critical Thinking

To uncover and distinguish between solid facts (truth),
probably truths, and falsehoods.

To identify and reduce bias.

If a good friend states something,
you will be more inclined to believe it, even if it's not true.
When this happens, image someone you don't like very much,
saying the same thing in an arrogant, condescending way.
Do you still believe it?

### Confirmation Bias

Research statements that interest you,
but be wary of confirmation bias.

Periodically question your beliefs.
Play devils advocate and find counter arguments
to your beliefs.



Lots of BS floating about.

Unfortunately the internet and social media has made it
too easy for people to spread unintentional
and sometime malicious falsehoods.

Use first principles, facts, and reasoning
to judge what others claim.
Train yourself to analyze each statement you hear and see
giving it a measure of truth (how probably the statement is).




## Frustration

Rushing to finish
as project you feel is almost done, but
you've been at it for hours?
Starting to feel burnt-out?

Time to take a break.  Go eat something.  Get some
exercise.  Take nap.  Your brain needs a rest.

If you continue on, it's just going to get worse,
and you will likely make a big mistake, which will
only compound your frustration.

You will be much better off to take a break
and then come back to it after you have rested.
Though you feel bad now, after your rest you will be amazed 
how you feel and how productive you are.

Do something completely different to force
your mind to think of something else;
preferably do something where you don't have to
think much at all.  But whatever you do, don't
let your mind wonder back to the problem.
The reason you feel frustrated is because your mind is saturated 
on the problem and it needs a break; be sure
to give it one.



## Failure

Failure will happen.  It's not a question of if --
it's not even a question of when, but how often
and how big are they going to be.

Things rarely work the first time around, especially
if you are attempting something new.
Keep your expectations low and just expect 
it not to work on the first, second, or third try.

As painful and frustrating as it is, failure is the best teacher.
The more we fail, the more we learn.
Of course we can blindly go about trying things and failing,
and we will eventually get something that works.

But there is a better way to go about it.
The key is to maximize what we learn from each failure,
so we can effectively lower our total number of failures
for us to learn what we need to learn to complete a project.

When you fail, chances are you will be nearing your frustration limit.
If so, stop everything and take a break.
Only after when you have a clear head and are in a good
mood, critically analyze the failure.

Why did it occur?
Was it due to an oversight or a mistake?
Was the mistake easy to to make, and if so,
can you change something that would make
it harder, or better yet,
would eliminate the possibility of the mistake being repeated?

What was the consequence of the failure?
Is there a potential safety hazard involved?

Looking at this specific failure, can you foresee other similar
failures that can occur?
And if you are to identify a class of potential failures,
can you think of anything that would mitigate the entire class?
Make these insights can be absolute gold.
Yes, you can probably go back and patch a fix to 
prevent the failure from occurring again.
But identifying entire classes of failures,
and finding mitigations to the entire class
results in a far more robust product or process,
and can lead to true revolution in design.









## Requirements Before Design

- Must-haves, hard requirements, rules.
- Nice-to-haves, soft requirements, guidelines.
- Not intended.

Forcing yourself to seriously think about what's actually needed
from a project before starting to delve into the design
thing about how to build
the project can lead to interesting discoveries and 
revolutionary design.

All too often commercial product design does not follow this approach, 
but is more evolutionary, taking what's what's
already been done before and then adding new features and
aesthetics.  This can lead to some improvement over time
with each iteration, but often it also carries along bad concepts
and poorly thought out ideas just because they have been
copied and carried forward so many times that they
become standard even when they don't provide much utility.
