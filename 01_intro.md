# Introduction

Before entering kindergarten in 1979, my family moved to the foothills
of the Colorado Rockies just west of Fort Collins.
Shortly in the years that followed I made friends with
James Kennedy, Aaron Haas, John Frederick, and Mark Harvey
and we grew up together in this region known as Horsetooth:
named after the rock on the highest ridge, which overlooks
the town and most of the Front Range -- on a clear day
from the top of Horsetooth rock you can see Cheyenne, Wyoming
to the north, Pike's Peak to the south, Long's Peak to the west,
and the western edge of The Great Plains to the east.
Horsetooth is also is the name
of the reservoir that fills the valley between the first
and second hogback ridges nearest to town.
The five of us lived in the surrounding hills
near the shores of Inlet Bay: the largest of the seven
or eight coves of Horsetooth Reservoir; named because
it provided the inlet to the reservoir with the source
waters originated from the Colorado River,
odd considering that the Colorado is  .


In the early 80's, five kids living in the foothills west of Fort Collins,
Colorado became friends and grew up together.
I first met James Kennedy one day riding home on the school bus in the 
second grade; get gave me is his phone number and I worked on memorizing it
before he got off the bus.  

This book provides general know-how for building and riding stuff.
How to build and construct fun stuff few resources and non budget.

But this book is also about a group of friends growing up in the 80's and 90's in the foothills west of Fort Collins, Colorado;
an area known as Horsetooth, named for the rock resting on the highest ridge overlooking
the town and also the reservoir that fills the valley between the first pair of hogback ridges.
John Frederick, Aaron Haas, Mark Harvey, Tom Hawkins, and James Kennedy made of the core
group and were often accompanied by Micheal (John's brother), Jerry (James' brother),
and Fon "Allen" Duke who moved to the neighborhood and joined the group for a few years.
