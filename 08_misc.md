# Wetsuit

Expensive, but in some cases it can triple the length of the swimming season.
Don't try to save money by getting a spring suit (shorts, short sleeves).
Full suit, 4/3 mm thickness.
Horsetooth was always chilly, even in the middle of summer.
Even in summer, a wetsuit makes it comfortable to stay in the
water all day.
