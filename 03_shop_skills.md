## Tools

This guide strives for minimal, affordable tools -- and some tools we will make ourselves.
Also, no extravagant workshop space.

It's easy to build stuff if you access to a spacious workshop stocked with every 
tool imaginable.  It's hard  

Assumes only hand tools and some power tools,
but no benchtop machines and no floor standing machines
and no welding.

# Wood and Metalworking

I intentionally use the term woodworking instead of
carpentry because the later tends to conjure images of intricate
hand tools, dovetail joints, and beautifully crafted furniture pieces.
Whereas in our world of Horsetooth, wood served as a means to 
and end, it was not the end itself.
We often used wood due to its availability,
the ease of working with it,
and its characteristics of light weight
and strength to enhance the
end product of whatever we happened to be working towards.
This is not to say we were all about function and no form.
Wood is an excellent engineering material,
but it also has an incredibility beauty when properly finished --
I think we appreciated both aspects.
